# Brainfuck Interpreter

A [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) interpreter written in Rust with error handling, 
e.g. it throws an error if brackets don't match.
It also lets the user choose which datatype to store in the cell, e.g. i32 or u64 etc.

* `bf-interpreter.exe <FILE>` where FILE is the Brainfuck program to be run
