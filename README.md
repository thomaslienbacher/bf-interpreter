# Brainfuck Interpreter

A [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) interpreter written in Rust with error handling, 
e.g. throws an error if brackets aren't matching.
It also lets the user choose which type to store in the cell, e.g. i32 or u64 etc.

### How to use
* `bf-interpreter.exe <FILE>` where FILE is the Brainfuck program to be run
* Use the `bf-interpreter.exe -h` flag to get extra help
